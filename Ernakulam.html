                <p class="lead">Panieli Poru is a tourist spot in the Ernakulam region ,caused by a natural bottleneck in the flow of the Periyar River due to rock formations. Paniyeli Poru is an ideal location for one-day trekking. This 1.5 km trekking through riverside pathway will take you to the waterfalls. After walking around 400 m one has to cross the river by foot to reach the forest and walk forward about a kilometer to reach the cascade. You can also see numerous small islands in the river and you can hang out and roam around the jungle. It is not a hard trek and is easy when the water is low. </p>
